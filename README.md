# Aim
The purpose of this dataset is to also provide a real untouched Twitter data from real people across Ma-laysia to exhibit the nature of content as well as people’s writing style in social media for the use of other researchers.

# Overview
GSTMalaysia1218 is made up of Twitter data with GST-related tweets throughout the tax’s timeline from 2012 until October 2018. With GST being implemented across the globe, tweets in this corpus were made up only by people living in Malaysia. This dataset represents the voice of the people regarding the tax throughout its chronology and two months after it was replaced with SST. It also represents the na-ture of content and the style of writing in social media by Malaysians where it includes spelling varia-tions, Malay-English mixed sentences, English words spelt using Malay phonology, regional slang and no-vowel spelling. Although the GST Bill has been read in the Parliament earlier, 2012 was chosen as the starting year for the dataset due to the fact that tweets about GST in Malaysia was almost non-existent prior to then.
